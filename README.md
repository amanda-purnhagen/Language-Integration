# Language-Integration
Demonstrates my ability to integrate Python and C++ languages

# Project summary. What is being solved?
The purpose of this program is to learn how to integrate Python code and C++ code.
The following code within main.cpp includes functions that allow the communication 
between the two languages. It also contains code that asks the user for the name of
a file containing items bought at a grocery store in chronological order. It then 
displays a menu to the user who may then select their choice. Their choice then
determines which Python function will be executed and what information about the
grocery store will be displayed.

# What did you do particularly well?
My in-line comments and code to analyze the user's input file are particularly 
strong. I believe the code is clear, concise, and effective.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code when it comes to handling exceptions. I encountered some
problems with error handling in the code that communicated between C++ and Python.
Because of this, sometimes the menu loops and sometimes it does not. Handling 
exceptions better would make the code more efficient by handling problems as they
are encountered, and it would make the code more secure by checking that input is
valid.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of code I found the most challenging to write was the Python code that
read in the contents of a file and analyzed it, namely by counting how many times
each unique item was purchased throughout the day. I hesitated between using a 
dictionary and using a list, and in the end I ended up using both of them in the 
case that the user wants to see the whole list (option 1 and option 3 in the 
menu display). I am adding an invaluable tool and resource to my support network in 
the form of the knowledge of how to integrate languages and make them cooperate 
efficiently and effectively.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe that the skill of integrating C++ and Python is particularly transferable 
to other projects and course work. This is evident in the fact that we built off of
the same code for three separate projects. I believe this skill will have 
significant real-world applications. I predict that I will rarely, if ever, only use
one language to complete a coding project. Therefore, the ability to use C++ and 
Python together is invaluable. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program very maintainable, readable, and adaptable with the help of in-
line comments and coding conventions. This code is ready to be picked up by future
editors due to its clear purpose and concise, logical steps. Anyone looking to edit
or use the code need only read the comments to understand how each block functions.
Fellow programmers will easily recognize variables, functions, comments, etc. through
the use of common naming conventions.
